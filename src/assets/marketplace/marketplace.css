This main CSS file now imports all the organized sub-stylesheets:

1. utilities.css - CSS variables, theme support, accessibility, utility classes, and common gradients
2. animations.css - Consolidated keyframe animations, transitions, and animation utilities
3. buttons.css - Complete button system with all variants and states
4. layout.css - Main container, headers, sections, and layout components
5. filters.css - Search, filters, and filter bar components
6. listing-cards.css - Listing card grid, hover effects, and card interactions
7. listing-content.css - Listing item details, seller info, and card content
8. tags.css - Tag chip system and badge components
9. modals.css - Modal overlays, forms, and modal-specific components
10. offers-trades.css - Offers system and pending trades functionality

Changes made during optimization:
- Consolidated all animations and keyframes into animations.css
- Removed duplicate animation definitions across files
- Added common gradient utility classes to utilities.css to reduce repetition
- Centralized reduced motion preferences handling in animations.css
- Improved performance with proper will-change properties
- Maintained accessibility and responsive design features

Each file is focused on a specific aspect of the marketplace UI,
making it easier to maintain and update individual components.
